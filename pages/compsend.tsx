export const JPM = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>
        Based on the forecasted discounted cash flow (DCF) of JPM, which ranges
        from 65.70 to 91.81, it appears that the company's financial outlook is
        positive. However, sentiment analysis is a crucial factor to consider as
        well.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a sentiment bias of 0.75, indicating a generally positive sentiment
        towards the company, it suggests that the sentiment is favorable. This
        positive sentiment could potentially further enhance the company's
        forecasted DCF.
      </p>
      <p>
        Considering the sentiment and the company's predicted DCF, my general
        advice would be to capitalize on the positive sentiment by investing in
        strategies that maintain and boost customer satisfaction, brand
        reputation, and overall market perception.
      </p>
      <p>
        In terms of competitors, it is important to assess their state in the
        market. If JPM's competitors are struggling or facing negative
        sentiment, it could present an opportunity for JPM to gain market share
        and solidify its position. On the other hand, if competitors are
        performing well and have a positive sentiment, JPM may need to further
        differentiate itself to remain competitive and capture market
        opportunities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, leveraging the positive sentiment and focusing on strategic
        initiatives to drive growth and maintain a strong market position would
        be advisable.

export const AAPL = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>
        Based on the provided data, the company AAPL2 has a forecasted
        discounted cash flow (DCF) ranging from $173.09 to $152.85. The DCF is a
        financial model used to evaluate whether an investment is worthwhile
        based on future cash flows.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, let's analyze how the sentiment analysis, which reflects public
        sentiment towards the company, would affect the forecasted DCF. The
        sentiment bias is 0.7246, indicating a generally positive sentiment
        towards the company.
      </p>
      <p>
        A higher sentiment percentage suggests a more favorable sentiment, which
        could potentially have a positive impact on the company's performance. A
        positive sentiment can lead to increased consumer confidence, higher
        customer loyalty, and potentially improved financial results. This
        could, in turn, increase the company's forecasted DCF.
      </p>
      <p>
        Considering the positive sentiment bias, it is reasonable to assume that
        the company's forecasted DCF could be positively influenced by the
        current sentiment. However, it is important to consider other factors
        such as market conditions, competition, and industry trends.
      </p>
      <p>
        Speaking of competitors, it would be beneficial to assess the state of
        reasonable competitors in the market. By evaluating their market share,
        financial performance, product offerings, and customer sentiment, we can
        better understand the competitive landscape.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the competitors are struggling or facing negative sentiment, it could
        provide an opportunity for AAPL2 to gain market share and potentially
        improve its forecasted DCF. Conversely, if competitors are performing
        well or have a positive sentiment, it may require AAPL2 to strategize
        and differentiate itself to maintain or improve its position in the
        market.
      </p>
      <p>
        In conclusion, based on the analysis of the sentiment and predicted DCF,
        it appears that AAPL2 is in a favorable position. However, it is crucial
        to continuously monitor market conditions, competition, and adapt
        accordingly to ensure sustained success.

        Based on the given information, the company's forecasted discounted cash
        flows (DCF) are: ['21.44', '17.17', '30.15', '30.46', '25.57']. These
        DCF values represent the projected future cash flows of the company.
      </p>
      <p>
        Considering the sentiment analysis provided, with a bias of 0.63, it
        indicates that the sentiment towards the company is generally positive
        (as it is greater than 50%). This positive sentiment could have a
        favorable impact on the company's forecasted DCF.
      </p>
      <p>
        The positive sentiment suggests that the company is likely to attract
        more investors and customers, leading to increased cash flows. This, in
        turn, could potentially result in higher DCF values in the future.
        Therefore, it would be advisable to monitor and capitalize on this
        positive sentiment to maximize the company's value.
      </p>
      <p>
        When assessing competitors, it is important to consider their state in
        the market. If the competitors are struggling or have a negative
        sentiment, it could provide an opportunity for the company to gain a
        larger market share. This could further enhance the company's forecasted
        DCF.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, if the competitors are strong and have a positive
        sentiment, it may indicate a more competitive market. In such a
        scenario, the company should focus on its unique selling points,
        competitive advantages, and innovation to maintain or improve its
        forecasted DCF.
      </p>
      <p>
        To provide more specific advice, it would be helpful to have additional
        information such as the industry, market conditions, and the company's
        current financial health.

export const CBRE = () => {
  return (
    <div className="text-md px-16 mb-10 mt-24">
        Based on the forecasted discounted cash flow (DCF) of CBRE, which ranges
        from $4.81 billion to $19.46 billion, it appears that the company's
        future cash flows are expected to be positive. The DCF is a financial
        model used to evaluate the worthiness of an investment based on expected
        future cash flows. Now, let's consider the sentiment analysis, which indicates a bias of
        71.43% towards CBRE. This implies that the general sentiment towards the
        company is predominantly positive, which is favorable for its overall
        evaluation. Positive sentiment can lead to increased investor
        confidence, potential business opportunities, and improved market
        perception.
        Considering the positive sentiment and the predicted DCF, my advice for
        CBRE would be to capitalize on this positive sentiment to attract more
        investors and build strong partnerships. They should leverage their
        positive market perception to expand their business and explore new
        opportunities.
        In terms of competitors, CBRE operates in the real estate services
        industry, where it faces competition from companies like JLL (Jones Lang
        LaSalle), Cushman & Wakefield, and Colliers International. The state of
        these competitors in the market can have both positive and negative
        effects on CBRE.
        If the competitors are struggling or facing negative sentiment, CBRE may
        have an opportunity to gain market share and attract clients who are
        dissatisfied with their competitors' services. However, if the
        competitors are performing well and enjoying positive sentiment, CBRE
        may need to differentiate itself by focusing on its unique value
        proposition, expanding into new markets, or offering innovative
        services.
        In summary, CBRE should capitalize on the positive sentiment and the
        predicted DCF by leveraging its market perception to attract more
        investors and explore new opportunities. They should also closely
        monitor the state of their competitors in the market and adapt their
        strategies accordingly to maintain a competitive edge.
